        <h2>&#10022; What I'm all about &#10022;</h2><br>
        <p><strong>Hi again! I’m Ivana</strong>, a first-year student at FCSE with a deep interest in <em>both the technical and creative sides of development</em>. I enjoy digging into new topics on my own, especially in areas like <span style="color:#4682B4;">robotics</span> and <span style="color:#4682B4;">creative software development</span>.</p>

        <p>I’m passionate about solving problems through <strong>logic</strong> and <strong>creativity</strong> — I love <em>puzzles</em>, not just in games but in <strong>code</strong> and <strong>design</strong>. Whether it’s <span style="color:#DAA520;">debugging a program</span> or <span style="color:#DAA520;">improving a user experience</span>, I enjoy the challenge of making things <em>work better and smarter</em>.</p>

        <p><strong>Proficient in C++</strong> with a solid foundation in <em>structured</em> and <em>object-oriented programming</em>, I’ve built a strong understanding of how things work behind the scenes. I’m also comfortable with <strong>front-end web development</strong> using <span style="color:#2E8B57;">HTML</span>, <span style="color:#2E8B57;">CSS</span>, and <span style="color:#2E8B57;">JavaScript</span>.</p>

        <p>I’m currently learning and working in <strong>Unity</strong>, experimenting with both <em>2D</em> and <em>3D game development</em>. My goal is to create <strong>visually striking and meaningful games</strong> with <em>deep, interactive stories</em> that spark <span style="color:#9932CC;">puzzle-solving thinking</span> — the kind that makes people feel clever while having fun. I’m also taking a course in <strong>robotics</strong>, an area I’m genuinely excited about, aiming to build <em>practical and helpful software</em> that extends into the real world.</p>

        <p>I’m the kind of person who doesn’t stop until things not only <strong>function</strong>, but <strong>feel right</strong>. I pay attention to <em>detail</em>, love <em>learning in all forms</em>, and I’m always full of ideas. <strong>Brainstorming</strong> is one of my strengths, and I thrive when I’m working on something that challenges <em>both sides of my brain</em> — the technical and the creative.</p>

        <p>As a <strong>creative person</strong>, <span style="color:#FF69B4;">digital art</span> is my outlet.</p>

<!--<p>Hi, I’m Ivana, a first year student at FCSE with a deep interest in both the technical and creative sides
            of development. I enjoy digging into new topics on my own, especially in areas like robotics and
        creative software development.</p>

        <p>I’m passionate about solving problems through logic and creativity — I love puzzles, not just in games but in
            code and design. Whether it’s debugging a program or figuring out how to improve a user experience, I enjoy
            the challenge of making things work better and smarter.</p>

        <p>Proficient in C++ with a solid foundation in both structured and object-oriented programming, I’ve built up a
            strong understanding of how things work behind the scenes in software. I’m also comfortable with front-end
            web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

        <p> I’m currently learning and working in Unity, where I’m experimenting with creating both 2D and 3D games. My goal is to create visually striking and meaningful games with deep, interactive stories that spark puzzle-solving thinking —
            the kind that makes people feel clever while having fun.  At the same time, I’m taking a course in robotics — an area I’m genuinely excited about — as I aim to build practical and helpful software that extends into the real world.</p>

        <p>I’m the kind of person who doesn’t stop until things not only function, but feel right. I pay attention to
